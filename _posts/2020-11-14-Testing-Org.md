# Self-replicating spacecraft (Von-Neumann probe)

Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as
mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of
their exponential growth.[1] In theory, a self-replicating spacecraft could be sent to a neighbouring
planetary system, where it would seek out raw materials (extracted from asteroids, moons, gas giants,
etc.) to create replicas of itself. These replicas would then be sent out to other planetary systems.
The original "parent" probe could then pursue its primary purpose within the star system. This 
mission varies widely depending on the variant of self-replicating starship proposed.

# The games that humans play

Lex Fridman asked what is the main game we should play. According to George Hotz, we should solve 
immortality first and then figure out other mysteries. Lex made, which seems a good point, that 
if we get unlimited time, our curiosity would not exist. The reason humans are curius beings is
this feeling of limited time.
George made an amazing point about this. If we solve immortality, the next move would be to solve
human brain and plant a "feature" which makes us believe time if finite.
Mentioned here -> <https://youtu.be/_L3gNaAVjQ4?t=1560>

My thoughts : What if we have already solved immortality, but not biologically. Since the "physical" 
world is already governed by laws of physics which cannot break, maybe we solved it in a 
different way. More like the Hindu concept of cyclic incarnations of soul. This automatically solves
the second step according to george hotz, we don't need to hack the brain since our biological
mortality would still keep us curious beings.

So a human gets born, is curious to solve mysteries of nature due to limited lifespan of it's
biology, dies and "something" (aka soul) gets born again until we solve everything.

Now, what this means is there is a meta physical world where all this soul and stuff is happening
which we cannot see. There is a research paper discussing why we cannot see that.

# Memory Leaks in the simulation

According to george hotz, if someone can observe incidents not in his/her vincinity, it proves that
there are memory leaks in our "simulation". I didn't quite get it.
