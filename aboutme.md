title: About me
---

My name is Parimal Prasoon, and my [myer briggs](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/) personality type is [INTJ](https://eu.themyersbriggs.com/en/tools/MBTI/MBTI-personality-Types/INTJ). I also happen to be an autodidact, and I have always hated the traditional classroom approach to learning. 

My interests include gaming, building software, reading reddit and tinkering with my Emacs config. I use Emacs because -

- It's the best editor out there.
- Jeff Dean uses it.

I also love Linux, and have been using it from the past 4 years as my only OS. My primary game is League of Legends,
because I like to suffer in my free time. My favorite movie is The Social Network, and favorite TV series is Silicon
Valley.
