title: About me
---

My name is Parimal Prasoon, and my [myer briggs personality type](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/) is [INTJ](https://eu.themyersbriggs.com/en/tools/MBTI/MBTI-personality-Types/INTJ). I also happen to be an autodidact, and I have always hated the traditional classroom approach to learning. But writing big words won't get you a job so I am also pursuing a B.Tech in CSE from VIT Bhopal University.

My interests include gaming, building software, reading reddit and tinkering with my Emacs config. I use Emacs because -

- It's the best editor out there.
- Jeff Dean uses it.

I also love Linux, and have been using it from the past 4 years as my only OS. Yeah, I game using WINE, so there's that.
